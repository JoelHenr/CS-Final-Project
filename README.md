# CS-Final-Project
This is a study that considers how impactfully monetary and fiscal policies have on stimulating the economy. 

To replicate this study, click on the file named "CSP.R". Download this file into RStudio or a equivalent environment. Then, source this file and it shall run all three models expressed in the research document "M&F Policies.PDF". The first model is a multivariable linear regression, the second model is the multivariable regression with robust standard errors, while the last model includes the multivariable regression with cluster robust standard errors. These different models will differentiate between the the standard deviations and in order to better understand possible implications from heteroskedasticity, these models correct for it.
